Python Project for reading QR Codes, formatting them, and creating data to turn into QR Codes.
This project works with the 'data/' local directory, and will create it if not present. All reading / interpreting files scripts will not run if the directory is not present or data files are not present in the directory.
Please make sure you have read/write permissions in the folder.
